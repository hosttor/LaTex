\item Discovery - through a process of surveys and meetings we'll gather all the information we need to have the best understanding of your business and goals.
\item Architecture - just like a building, a website needs a solid blueprint. Together we'll determine the best way to organize your website and sketch out a rough outline.
\item Content - with a solid blueprint in place it will be your job to collect, organize, edit, and deliver to us content for each page of the website.
\item Design - at the same time you are working on content our team will be creating non-functioning comprehensive layouts showing possible design directions.
\item Development - with all the necessary architecture, content, and design elements in hand we'll create the first working version of your website.
\item Launch - getting your website "go live" ready will inevitably require several rounds of revisions and polish. Once the website is ready, we'll go through the final launch checklist.
\item Warranty - your site is now live! Over the next several weeks our team will be training you on how to manage the website and helping you solve any issues.
